# Learn React: Chat App

This is a project I created for learning React. It's a Slack clone that is built in React and powered by Socket.io.

## Development

Each facet of the application is located in a subdirectory:

* **client** - This houses the client application which is built in React
* **server** - This houses the backend server which is powered by Node.js and Express

## VSCode Workspace

You can use the included VSCode workspace to streamline development.
